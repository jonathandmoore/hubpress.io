= Rhizosphere metatranscriptome analysis

I'm a co-investigator on the Roots of Decline project looking at the interactions between crop rotations, rhizosphere microbiome and oilseed rape crop yield.  The project has been tweeting progress https://twitter.com/BBSRC_SARISA and it's been interesting to see the combination of experimental plots, field sampling from farms, and lab work.  Now the first samples are being sequenced, so it's time for some fettling.
